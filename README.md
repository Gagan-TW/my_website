# Refract Documentation Site

This is a capstone project developed as part of the **Technical Writing Mentorship Program – Product Documentation Cohort**. The goal of this project is to simulate the real-world process of documenting a developer framework using industry-standard tools and best practices.

This documentation site is built with **[Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/)** and showcases how to structure, author, and publish product documentation for a JavaScript UI framework called **Refract**.

## 🌟 What is Refract?

**Refract** is a declarative UI framework built on top of React. It introduces the concept of **optics** (lenses and refractions) to simplify state management and component composition.

This documentation covers:

- Core concepts like JSX, conditional rendering, rendering lists, and UI composition
- Advanced topics such as optics, custom optics, managing state, and side-effects
- Modular structure and reuse of logic
- Developer-friendly API documentation
- Blog articles for technical storytelling
