Whether you're documenting a feature, a library, or an API—**clarity is everything**.

Here are some practices I followed while writing documentation for Refract, a JavaScript UI framework:

### 1. Use Real-World Examples

People don’t just want theory. They want to **see it in action**.

That’s why every concept in the Refract docs includes:

- Code snippets
- Usage examples
- Before/after comparisons


### 2. Follow a Style Guide

I followed the [Google Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style) to maintain:

- Consistency
- Clear headings
- Active voice
- Simple language

### 3. Structure Content Logically

Each section of the docs answers one user question:

- **Introduction** → What is Refract?
- **Concepts** → How does it work?
- **Tutorials** → How do I start?
- **API** → What does each function do?


### 4. Keep Iterating

Writing docs isn’t “one and done.” I constantly:

- Get feedback from teammates
- Read other projects' docs
- Update structure and navigation


In upcoming posts, I’ll share how I structured our sidebar, and how to write great tutorials from scratch!

Happy documenting!
