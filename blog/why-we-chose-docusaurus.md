When we started building Refract, our goal was not just to create a powerful UI state management framework—but also to make sure it was easy to **learn and adopt**.

That’s why documentation was a priority from day one.

### Why Docusaurus?

We explored several documentation frameworks like Astro Starlight, VuePress, and MkDocs. But we finally chose **Docusaurus** because:

- 🧩 It’s React-based—just like Refract.
- 📚 Built-in support for versioned docs and blogs.
- 🎨 Easy to customize layout, themes, and navigation.
- ⚙️ Markdown + MDX = simple + powerful.
- 🚀 One-click deploy to GitHub Pages or Vercel.

### Our Customizations

We customized our Docusaurus site with:

- A custom sidebar structure (`sidebars.js`)
- A separate section for API reference
- A "Guides" tab for tutorials and onboarding
- A "Blog" tab to share updates and insights

### What’s Next?

In future blog posts, we’ll cover:

- How we created diagrams for state lenses
- How to contribute to Refract docs
- How we version our documentation
