# Introduction

Welcome to **Refract**, a lightweight and reactive JavaScript framework designed to simplify state management and UI development.

Whether you're building a prototype or a full-scale application, Refract helps you organize your code, manage state clearly, and build modular components with ease.

## What Is Refract?

Refract is a declarative UI framework that applies a lens-based architecture—similar to how light refracts through a prism. It allows you to isolate and interact with parts of your application’s state in a predictable, testable, and readable way.

## Why Use Refract?

- **Built for Simplicity**: Quick setup, minimal boilerplate, and developer-friendly syntax.
- **Lens-Based Architecture**: Use lenses to manage isolated, composable pieces of state.
- **Optimized for React**: Seamless integration with the React ecosystem.
- **Clear State Transitions**: Debug and test easily with immutable and observable updates.

## Who Should Read This Guide?

This guide is written for:

- Front-end developers who use or want to learn React.
- Developers interested in scalable and composable state management.
- Teams building reactive, component-based UIs.

## What Will You Learn?

By the end of this documentation, you’ll be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of lenses and optics in Refract.
- Set up and structure your Refract-based application.
- Handle state, effects, and rendering with clarity.
- Explore advanced usage patterns to build robust UI flows.
