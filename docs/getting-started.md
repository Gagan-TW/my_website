# Getting Started
Welcome to the Refract documentation. Refract is a lightweight JavaScript library for building modern user interfaces. It helps you manage state, side effects, and component logic in a clear and predictable way.
This guide will help you install Refract and use it in your application.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure the following are set up on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- A basic understanding of JavaScript and React
If you are new to React, you can refer to the [React documentation](https://react.dev/learn) to get started.
## Installation
To install Refract UI in your project, run the following command:
```bash
npm install refract-ui
```
or with Yarn:
```
yarn add refract-ui
```
This command will add Refract as a dependency in your project.
## Basic Usage
After installation, you can begin using Refract components in your project.
Hereâ€™s a basic example:
```
import { Button } from 'refract-ui';
function App() {
  return <Button label="Click Me" />;
}
export default App;
```
